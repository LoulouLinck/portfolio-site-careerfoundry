# Portfolio

## Objective
A single-page application to showcase my professional portfolio, designed following responsive design principles both for desktop and mobile. 
For practice reasons I've chosen to refrain from using any libraries or build tools, so every line of code here is hand-written.

## Technology 
* HTML    
* CSS 
* Javascript

## Design
I followed a responsive design principle both for desktop and mobile. I used mainly HTML and CSS to design my webpage, however I included some snippets of Javascript like: Scroll-up button, sticky/toggle-navbar, text-animation and project tab.
